        <h1>HAPPY GANESH CHATURTHI</h1>
        <P>Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayak Chaturthi or Ganeshotsav, holds special significance for Hindus as it is believed that Lord Ganesh was born on this day. Lord Ganesha is worshiped as the 'Pratham Pujya,' which means that he is the first God to be worshipped before any auspicious event.</P>
